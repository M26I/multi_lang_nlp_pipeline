# 🌐 Multi-Language NLP Pipeline

This project is a multi-language Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that:
- Detects the input language,
- Translates it to English (if needed),
- Performs basic NLP analysis,
- Extracts named entities using advanced NER,
- Evaluates sentiment with a modern transformer-based model.

Built with `Streamlit`, it's designed to be both interactive and beginner-friendly.

## 🚀 Demo

Launch the app locally with:

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```
---
## 📦 Features
- 🧠 Language Detection & Translation: Auto-detects language and translates to English using deep_translator.

- 🗣️ Basic NLP Analysis: Tokenization, polarity, subjectivity, and noun phrase extraction.

- 🔍 Advanced NER: Named Entity Recognition powered by transformer models (e.g., spaCy or HuggingFace).

- ❤️ Advanced Sentiment Analysis: High-quality sentiment classification beyond simple polarity.

- 🌐 Multilingual Support: Accepts input in most languages (tested with English, French, German, Spanish, etc).

- 🧪 Streamlit UI: Intuitive and responsive web UI for testing and demos.

## 📝 Sample Input Texts

You can test the app with pre-written multilingual samples in the data/ folder. For example:

" Sport and Fitness in Your 30s:
Staying active in your 30s is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being..."

Add your own .txt files in different languages to extend the demo.
